Dear Miss Angelina Jolie,

Recognizing your very busy schedule, I’m sending you thisnote as a reminder to our interview on 21 September at 2pm to be held at the Ghana Embassy. This interview is regarding the adoption of the orphans twins Jack and Jessica. 

Would you please have your assistant drop me a note or phone if you require further information.

Thank you and I’m sincerely looking forward to meeting you in person.


Regards
Dax Cheng
